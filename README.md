# Jiji

I would like a service that encourages me to write by sharing the works of others authors. 

What is a work? A work could anthing from a quote to a series of books. Tweets and blog posts are also works.

It's curious to see what AI can produce. How can machine learning encourage and help us to write more?

I'd like to be able to discuss, edit, and add to the work within a thread. 

# Getting Started

### GQL Server

```
yarn
yarn start
```
## Client

```
browserify main.js -o bundle.js
```

## Deploy

```
